## Current Progress

### Release 3 : Items on Menus

* Create a many-to-many relationship between items and menus.
* Using IRB, test your data model.  Verify that you can assign Items to a Menu; and then, see all the Items that belong to a given Menu; and given an Item, see all the Menus that Item is on.
* Create the Items on Menus View (don't worry about styling yet).  In the Items on Menus View, the drop down should be filled with all possible items.
* Use Rspec, Shoulda, and Capybara to test your models and integration.

### Release 4: AJAXify it.
* Use AJAX to Implement Adding and Deleting items from menus on the Items on Menus View
* Use AJAX to implement the "Add Item" button on the Items View.
* Use AJAX to implement the "Add Menu" button on the Menus View
* Verify existing tests still pass (hint: turn on JavaScript for your Capybara tests)

### Release 5: Errors
* Use JavaScript and HTML 5 to validate your forms before submission.
* Use the Active Record `errors` to display errors to the form after submission.

### Release 6: CSS
* Add CSS to make it beautiful.  (At the minimum it should look like the mockup).

### Release 7: Refactor to beautiful code
* Go through your entire app and make certain that each line is as clear, concise, and readable as you can make it.
